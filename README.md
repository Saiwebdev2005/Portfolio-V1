# My Portfolio Website

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website. This website is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It's currently under construction, but feel free to explore the code!

## About Me

I'm a frontend developer who loves to create engaging web experiences. While my primary focus is on frontend development, I also spend time practicing data structures and algorithms to enhance my problem-solving skills.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Running the Code

If you'd like to run the code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Now, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. Voila! You're viewing my portfolio website in your local development environment!

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal project, I'm open to contributions. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Coding! ðŸ’»
